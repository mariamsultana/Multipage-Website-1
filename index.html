      <h2>About the Kingdom</h2>
      <p class="argo">
        Pelias is the king of Iolcus and is enjoying a peaceful life in his residence of Iolcus (Thessaly). He owns a luxury palace, thousands of hectares of land rich in gold, iron, and timber.

But there is a little problem in this paradise. He is not the rightful king of Iolcus. He usurped the throne to his half brother.

Pelias doesnâ€™t know it yet, but his half brother has a son, named Jason, who he never met. Jason is fit, handsome, and endowed with great intelligence.
